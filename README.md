# Getting Started with Create React App - A Website For Exotic Cars

A website called Exotic Garage was made to display some of the most prestigious cars on the market today. The website will provide information on each car and also display the speed of the cars relative to one another.

## Deliverables:

 * Display a card for each car with its information 
 * Create the ability to log in to the website or log out
 * Make a page that will display the horsepower of the cars 
	* They should move from one side of the page to the other
	* The one with the highest horsepower should get to the end of the page first

### Advanced Deliverable:

 * Allow users to submit a car so they can then display the horsepower of that car relative to the rest of the cars on the site 
 * Click on the car and go to a separate page that will display more images of the car 
	* Add sounds so the user can hear the engine of the car
